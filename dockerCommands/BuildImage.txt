like we have a structure as shown in the screenshot:-

1.Create a DockerFile and add below lines

$We have to downlaod the node.js image
-> FROM node:19-alpline

$Copy the files and folders whatever you want:
-> COPY src /app/ (/app/ is the new directory in the container and src is the folder present in the local machine)

$ Change the directory or working directory to install all things in right place:
-> WORKDIR /app

$ RUN npm install

$ CMD "node" "server.js"



2. Go to terminal: to build image

docker build -t <image name> <location>
->docker build -t node-app .

--> now run the container in the same port.

3. check the image:
-> docker image
